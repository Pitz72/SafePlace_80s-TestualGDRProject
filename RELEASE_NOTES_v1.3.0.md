## 🧪 **Testing Results**

### ✅ **All Tests Passed**
- [x] Map generation (250x250) working correctly
- [x] UI interface unchanged and stable  
- [x] Viewport scrolling functioning properly
- [x] CRT colors and effects maintained
- [x] Start (S) visible in northwest quadrant
- [x] End (E) visible in southeast quadrant  
- [x] Player spawns at Start position
- [x] Rest stops (R) visible as bright yellow elements
- [x] Blinking effects working for S and E
- [x] Legend updated with "R Ristoro" entry
- [x] Popup tooltips working for rest stops

### 🎯 **User Validation**
> "Ok, ora funziona tutto. Non mi sembra ci siano state regressioni. Le R sono ancora troppo rare ma per ora va bene."

**Translation**: "Ok, now everything works. I don't see any regressions. The R are still a bit rare but it's fine for now."
